# mini-jam-156-mushroom


## TODO

- [x] ğŸ’š MVP idea - mushroom.
  - The player begins as a spore flying in the air. The goal is to find a good germination spot.
  - When the spore lands, it spawns mycelium roots.
  - The mycelium must collect nutrients from nutrient-rich areas.
  - The mycelium must deposit nutrients to plant roots.
  - After a limited amount of root-growth, a mushroom sprouts.
  - A new spore is created - the player can choose among a few possible spores, each of which is a mutation of the current one.
  - This process continues forever or at least for a long time.
